# InstantImprovement
InstantImprovement is a desktop application that demonstrates emotion-recognition-algorithms.
The emotion-recognition-logic is taken from Affdex SDK by Affectiva.
This repository contains the source-code for a .NET desktop-application running on Microsoft Windows platforms and was developed based on the work of the saviourofdp/affdex-me. 

## Project-Context
This software represents the prototype of the project-group eXponentials in the university-project "ProVIL" at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (https://www.ipek.kit.edu/70_4067.php). 
Student groups gather virtually to come up with product ideas that get elaborated afterwards. 
InstantImprovement targets the Soft-Skill market and wants to emphasize the use of emotion-recognition to generate authentic and immediate feedback by analyzing the speaker and/or the audience in collaborative tools.
The developed application demonstrates the fundamental capabilites of the implemented logic and provides insights about background-data-processing.
